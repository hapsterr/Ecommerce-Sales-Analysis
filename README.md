# Ecommerce Sales Analysis using MySQL &amp; Power BI

## Project Overview
This project analyzes synthetic e-commerce sales data to identify trends and provide business insights.
The analyses was done using **MySQL** for data preparation and querying, and **PowerBI** for creating visual report.

## Project Objectives
- Understand Sales performance overtime
- Explore revenue and discounts on difference categories
- Study payment method preferences
- Provide recommendations to improve revenue and reduce business risks

## Key Insights
1. **Overall Sales Performance**
   - Sales stayed above 300 units for most of the year but fell to 245 units in November.
   - Total revenue was above 64,000 Rupees in most months but dropped to 51,915 Rupees in November.
   -  The average discount stayed between 17% and 20%, so it doesn’t explain the drop in sales and revenue. 

2. **Clothing Category Performance**
   - Clothing category had the highest total revenue even though it is only third in total sales.
   - It also has the lowest average discount (17.92%), and it May average discount (%) was at its highest for clothing category yet total revenue was almost at its lowest.
   -  This might suggest that customers are willing to pay higher prices for clothing products without needing large discounts.
   -  From May (22% discount) to November (15% discount), the shop steadily reduced discounts, yet clothing revenue stayed strong.
   -  This shows that heavy discounting is not the main driver of clothing sales.
3. **Payment Method Overview**
   - Online payments make up about 80% of all sales, showing that customers trust the platform.
   - Cash on Delivery still plays an important role, accounting for almost 20% of sales. However, COD comes with risks and extra costs — for example, if a customer refuses to pay on delivery (maybe because they are unhappy with the product), the business still has to cover delivery expenses, and it makes delays for the business since the funds still need to be deposited to the business account.
  
## Recommendations
- **Clothing Discounts: ** Since discounts do not strongly impact clothing Category revenue, the shop could reduce unnecessary discounts to protect profit margins. Instead, focus on product quality, and seasonal promotions to sustain and grow revenue.
- **November Drop: ** Investigate possible causes (festive season timing, stock availability, or marketing) to avoid future declines.
- **Reduce Cash on delivery Dependence:** Encourage digital payments (UPI, cards, Net Banking) with small incentives. This will cut Cash on delivery risks and improve efficiency.
